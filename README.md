Mirror of Conque Vim plugin, which is hosted on code.google.com in svn.

Official project site: http://code.google.com/p/conque/

This is intended for my private use and not an "official" git mirror. I'm not
going to synchronize it frequently with original svn repo, maybe once in one or
two months.
